# geodesic-flow-visualizer
A WebAssembly-based application for computing and interactively visualizing geodesic flows and curvature on parametric 3D surfaces. Provides real-time differential-geometry computations (Christoffel symbols, Gaussian and mean curvature) and exportable geodesic paths for research validation and reproducible experiments.
